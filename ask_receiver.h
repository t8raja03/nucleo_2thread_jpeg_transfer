			Description
				Re/initializes the receiver object with given parameters.
				Re/initializing receiver object will fail if initialized receiver object already exists.
				The rx address of the receiver is set to ASK_RECEIVER_BROADCAST_ADDRESS.
				Value of rx_address is set to the new rx address.
			Parameters
				rx_frequency
					The frequency of the receiver. This value is required to be valid frequency or 0, or the function fails.
					Valid frequencies are 1000, 1250, 2500 and 3125.
					If this parameter is 0 and the receiver is initialized it will shutdown.
					If this parameter is 0 and the receiver is not initialized it will not be initialized.
					The receiver is not initialized after it is shutdown.
				rx_pin
					Mbed OS pin name for rx pin.
			Return
				If the function succeeds, the return value is true and false on failure.
